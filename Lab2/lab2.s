;	This is a different way to read the bits in the Morse Code LUT than is in the lab manual.
; 	Choose whichever one you like.
; 
;	First - loop until we have a 1 bit to send  (no code provided)



	SUBS 	R8, #1					;R8 keeps count of each char, so REMOVE_ZERO only happens each time you get a new char
	BEQ		REMOVE_ZERO

	BEQ		REMOVE_ZERO
	LSR		R1, R1, #1				; right shift back since code below will do a bit shift first and then determine light on/off
	
	
;
;	This is confusing as we're shifting a 32-bit value left, but the data is ONLY in the lowest 16 bits, so test at bit 16 for 1 or 0
;	Then loop thru all of the data bits:
;

BLINK_LETTER
		
		
		
		MOV		R6, #0x10000	; Init R6 with the value for the bit, 16th, which we wish to test
		LSL		R1, R1, #1	; shift R1 left by 1, store in R1	
		ANDS	R7, R1, R6	; R7 gets R1 AND R6, Zero bit gets set telling us if the bit is 0 or 1	
		BEQ		LIGHT_OFF			; branch somewhere it's zero
		BNE		LIGHT_ON			; branch somewhere - it's not zero

		;....  lots of code

	BL		DELAY					;1500ms
	B		NextChar				;get next char in word



;	Alternate Method #2
;
; Ok - you are a hot coder and you've got time to burn and want to shorten your code.  Try this:
; Reverse the Morse Code LUT and encode the bits as follows (01 = short, 11 = 3 delay long, 00 = done)
; By doing this one could just shift right and peel off 2 bits at a time, without the need to count to know when you're
; done or peel off a bunch of empty 0's.  This method means that the encoded information ALTERNATES between on and off!
; The first 01 or 11 count is LED on, and the following one is off, then the next is on ....  till you hit 00

;
;	Additional Work
; 
; Are you still bored?  You want to make sweet Morse Code Music?
; Well - lets get the speaker humming.
;
; Note: If you do use this then decrease the delay to 50 to 100ms so that one can both "read" the LED and audio pattern
;
; By modifying your 500ms delay loop to be two loops - an inner loop of 0x200 that toggles the speaker when done
;  and an outer loop to ensure that the total delay is 500ms
;
; The speaker is on Port 0 ping 26 and by toggling it's at an audible frequency one can make a sound
;
; A simple hack to this code is to modify the EOR line to use another register.  If the register is
; 0x4000000 then the speaker will sound; but if it's 0x0 then the speaker stays silent
;
;		LDR	R4, =LED_PORT_ADR	; setup speaker address
;		MOV	R5, #0x4000000		; This is bit 26 which goes to the speaker
;Again		MOV	R3, #0x200
;loopBuzz	MOV	R2, #0x200		; aprox 1kHz since looping 0x10000 times is ~ 10Hz
;loopMore	SUBS	R2, #1			; decreament inner loop to make a sound;
;		BNE	loopMore
;		EOR	R5, #0x4000000		; toggle speaker output
;		STR	R5, [R4]		; write to speaker output
;		SUBS	R3, #1
;		B	Again
